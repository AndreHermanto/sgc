                        Genomic technology is a relatively new and disruptive technology in healthcare. Its successful 
                        implementation relies on whole-of-system change. Genomic medicine has the potential to transform 
                        how we deliver healthcare. It promises better patient outcomes and a more efficient health system 
                        through rapid diagnosis, early intervention, prevention and targeted therapy.

                        In the next five years, <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/203554v1.full">genomic 
                        data from an estimated 60 million patients globally is expected to be generated from health care</a>. 
                        The volume and complexity of that data – and how it is accessed, shared and applied – are enormous. 
                        So too are the associated issues around genomic medicine such as data storage, ethics and privacy, 
                        nationally-consistent practices, patient access, economic impact and workforce capability.

                        The Australian Genomics Health Alliance (<b>Australian Genomics</b>) was launched in 2016 to address 
                        many of these challenges and to build the evidence to inform the integration of genomic medicine into 
                        mainstream healthcare. We were established with a National Health and Medical Research Council grant 
                        in 2016 and now manage over $55M in genomic projects, with additional funding from philanthropy and 
                        the Genomics Health Futures Mission.

                        Our network comprises more than 80 partners and 440 investigators. They include clinicians, researchers 
                        and diagnostic geneticists who work across 18 clinical Flagships studies and four research program areas.
