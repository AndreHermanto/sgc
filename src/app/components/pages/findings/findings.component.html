                    Notice on the use of Australian Genomics cohort genomic data
                </p>
                <p>
                    The de-identified, aggregated summary-level genomic data made available for querying in Variant Atlas is from <a href="https://www.australiangenomics.org.au/" target="_blank">Australian Genomics</a> clinical flagship studies. Participants provided consent for a primary analysis to be performed as part of an Australian Genomics clinical flagship that was targeted to a specific clinical question, and involved the use of gene panels (see <a href="https://panelapp.agha.umccr.org/" target="_blank">PanelApp Australia</a>). Many clinical analysis pipelines used bioinformatic gene masking (‘soft masking’) to limit the chance of identifying incidental findings (genes or variants of clinical significance that are outside the primary clinical reason for testing). The genomic data incorporated in Variant Atlas are not masked and include all identified genetic variants.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You may, through querying the data, identify genetic variants which may be of clinical relevance or considered important to the health information of a participant: either in relation to the condition they underwent genomic testing for, or for a different condition or different genetic risk. At this time, <b>Australian Genomics will not accept from researchers, or return to participants, results that are identified through secondary analysis of genomic data using the Variant Atlas database. </b>      
                </p>

                <p>
                    The data are provided for research purposes only. It is not suitable for diagnostic purposes. We are guided by the <a href="https://www.ga4gh.org/wp-content/uploads/Framework-Version-10September2014.pdf" target="_blank">GA4GH Framework</a> for Responsible Sharing of Genomic and Health-Related Data, and therefore will not attempt to re-identify anonymised data unless where expressly authorised by law to protect the privacy of participants.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Should this policy change in future an updated notice will be made available.
